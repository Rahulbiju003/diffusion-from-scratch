# Diffusion Model Using Torch 

This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) from scratch in PyTorch. It allows image generation through the process of adding and reversing Gaussian noise.

## Features
- Implements forward and reverse diffusion
- Uses a simple U-Net architecture
- Supports custom datasets
